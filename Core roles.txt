Work order & time tracking rules (critical)
Timer rules
A technician can have only one active timer at a time (recommended; prevents garbage data).
A labor line item can have multiple techs clocked in simultaneously (team jobs).
Time entries are event-based and immutable (audit trail). Totals are calculated.
Status events
START
PAUSE (reason required)
RESUME
STOP
ADJUST (manager-only; requires reason)
Actual vs Estimated calculations
Estimated (line): work_order_line.estimated_minutes
Actual (line): sum of all time sessions durations for that line
Estimated (WO): sum estimated of labor lines
Actual (WO): sum actual of labor lines
Variance: actual − estimated (minutes/hours)
You’ll show both:
Clocked time (true time)
Optional later: billable time (flat-rate override)
Key UI behavior details

Header summary:

Variance
Parts status (All issued / waiting / partial)
Labor lines table:
Description | Est | Actual | Variance | Status | Assigned | “Clock In” (tech view)
Parts lines / pick list:
SKU | Qty needed | Reserved | Issued | Location/Bin
Tech clock experience
“Clock In” immediately starts a session and sets line to In Progress
If tech clocks into another line, the app must:
stop or pause prior session automatically (your choice; I recommend stop with prompt)
Pause requires reason:
Waiting parts
Waiting approval
Diagnostic hold
Lunch/Break
Other
 
One active timer per tech: Yes (recommended)
 
Team clocking: Allowed
 
Actual time uses: Sum of all tech sessions (so team jobs consume more actual labor)
 
Parts reservation timing: On WO approval
 
Adjustments: Manager-only, always logged
